        <h2>Using This File to Format Your Paper</h2>
        <p>If you are not using Word as your word processor, print this document and read more about the required formatting guidelines. However, if you are using Word, you can (and should) save time by 
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>Prepare your manuscript in Microsoft Word or export it from a different word processor into RTF format,
            following
            the specifications that we show here.</p>
        <p>For papers that deal with data analysis, make the data available to readers via a link you place in your
            paper to
            a website where you store your data, if at all possible. We can help.</p>
        <p>When you submit your paper for review, make sure that you have anonymized your paper by removing all
            references
            to yourself or your institution. Make sure these are removed from the document properties as well. To have
            your
            paper reviewed, you need first to submit a “blinded” version (without author or affiliation information)
            that
            can be blind reviewed. After your paper is accepted, add the author information.</p>
        <h2>Language and Grammar Consistency</h2>
        <p>We publish papers written in English. If you have questions on English grammar or punctuation, search the web
            for
            guidance. You can find excellent guides at and</p>
        <p>While we prefer the use of U.S. spelling, we accept other versions of English as long as they are used
            consistently throughout the paper.</p>
        <h3>Use of the singular “they”</h3>
        <p>When the gender of a person is unknown, the use of the singular “they” is accepted. Do not use expressions
            such
            as “s/he” or “his or her.” For example, “Each student submitted their art portfolio to the committee” is
            correct. If using the singular “they” as a generic third-person pronoun seems awkward, try rewording the
            sentence or using the plural, such as “All students submitted their art portfolios to the committee” or “The
            art
            portfolio of each student was submitted to the committee.” More information about this is at and</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Content</h2>
        <h3>First Page Layout</h3>
        <p>To put the first page of your document in the proper format, copy the content of the first page from this
            file
            into your document and fill in the abstract information.</p>
        <h3>Author information (added after paper has been accepted)</h3>
        <p>Once the Editor has accepted your paper, insert the full name, the affiliation (University or Company), City,
            Country, and email address for each author into the table on the first page. Insert additional rows if there
            are
            more than two authors. If there is more than one author, place an asterisk after the corresponding author’s
            name.</p>
        <p>In the Author section at the end of the paper, add a short biography and a head-and-shoulders photo (if
            available) for each author.</p>
        <h3>What to put in the abstract</h3>
        <p>The abstract is a brief summary of the contents of the article; it should give enough information to make the
            reader want to learn more about your research, but it needs to be concise. In each of the boxes on the first
            page, enter one or two brief sentences appropriate for your paper. Omit citations from the abstract;
            citations
            for the paper’s sources do appear in the body of the paper.</p>
        <p>If any of the abstract subtopics do not apply to your paper, put “NA” in that box.</p>
        <h2>Body of Paper</h2>
        <h3>Introduction or background</h3>
        <p>All papers should begin with an introduction that sets the stage for the discussion. For some disciplines, it
            is
            more appropriate to use Background as an alternative first section.</p>
        <h3>Body</h3>
        <p>The body is a collection of multiple sections describing the main content of the paper. You should use up to
            three levels of headings to categorize content as deemed necessary: Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This section summarizes the paper, presents challenges, suggests future study, and so on to create a lasting
            impression of the paper.</p>
        <h3>Appendix</h3>
        <p>If there is an appendix, place it after the References and before the Biography. If there is more than one
            appendix, add a letter after “Appendix.” Appendices must be mentioned at the appropriate places within the
            body
            of the document.</p>
        <p>If you have used a questionnaire in a study, include a copy of it as an appendix.</p>
        <h3>References</h3>
        <p>Following the conclusion is a list of all references used in the body of the paper. The current APA
            formatting
            guidelines are used to make internal citations within the body as well as provide the complete alphabetic
            list
            of reference citations at the end of the paper. (See the Entering References section for more details. We
            have
            placed a summary of these guidelines at ) The References list contains only works cited in the paper and all
            works cited in the paper must be listed in the References section.</p>
        <h2>Author Information with Picture</h2>
        <p>After the paper is accepted, at the end of the paper, for each author please provide a one or two paragraph
            biography that describes the author’s background relevant to this article. If you have one, insert a
            head-and-shoulder photo to the left of the biography of each author or send it separately and we will insert
            it.
        </p>
    </section>
    <h2>Page Formatting</h2>
    <p>To make it easier to read the paper online, use single-column formatting for the paper.</p>
    <h3>Page Size</h3>
    <p>Set the paper size to Letter, which is 8 1/2 by 11 inches.</p>
    <h3>Margins</h3>
    <p>Set the top and bottom margins to 1 inch and the right and left margins to 1.25 inches.</p>
    <h3>Headers and Footers</h3>
    <p>Insert page numbers in the footer. We will add the remaining information for the headers and footers.</p>
    <h3>Hyphenation</h3>
    <p>Hyphenate the text in the document. To turn on hyphenation:</p>
    <p>Select Language on the Layout or Page Layout menu.</p>
    <p>Select Hyphenation.</p>
    <p>Check Automatically hyphenate document.</p>
    <h2>Footnotes</h2>
    <p>Footnotes should not be used at all. Insert your note within the body of the paper (if it is important) or omit
        it. The editors will remove footnotes and place the material within the text.</p>
    <h2>Paragraph Styles (This is a Heading 1 Style)</h2>
    <p>If you have not attached these styles to your paper, use Word’s default paragraph styles for your document,
        making just the changes indicated below.</p>
    <h2>Headings (This is a Heading 2 Style)</h2>
    <p>Do not number headings. Enter the headings with no outline numbers or letters in front of them.</p>
    <h3>Paper title</h3>
    <p>Use the Paper Title style for the title of your paper. It is centered with a border under it. The font for this
        style is Garamond, 16 point, Bold, and Small Caps.</p>
    <p>The paragraph formatting is Centered with a 6 point space after it and an underline border at the bottom. The
        “Keep with Next” property is selected.</p>
    <p>Capitalize the first letter of every major word. Do not use all upper case.</p>
    <h3>First level headings</h3>
    <p>Use the Heading 1 style for the title and for major headings. The font for this style is Garamond, 16 point,
        Bold, and Small Caps.</p>
    <p>The paragraph formatting has a 12 point space before and a 6 point space after it and an underline border at the
        bottom. The “Keep with Next” property is selected.</p>
    <p>Capitalize the first letter of every major word. Do not use all upper case.</p>
    <h3>Second level headings</h3>
    <p>Use the Heading 2 style for second level headings. The font for this heading is Garamond, 14 point, Bold, Italic
        and Small Caps. The space before the paragraph is 6 point and the space after is 3 point. The “Keep with Next”
        property is selected.</p>
    <p>Capitalize the first letter of every major word in second level headings. Do not use all upper case.</p>
    <h3>Third level headings (This is a heading 3 style)</h3>
    <p>Use the Heading 3 style for third level headings. The font for this heading is Garamond, 12 point, Bold. The
        space before the paragraph is 3 point and the space after is 3 point. The “Keep with Next” property is selected.
    </p>
    <p>Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns in this heading.</p>
    <h2>Text Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>Use the Normal style for paragraphs of text. The paragraph is single-spaced with no indentation and has a 6-point
        space after it. The font for this style is 11 point Garamond. Do not put blank lines between paragraphs.</p>
    <h3>Other types text of paragraphs</h3>
    <p>Forth level. Three levels of headings are enough for most papers. If you need another level, such as for this
        paragraph, use the Normal style and place the heading at the beginning of the paragraph in bold font.</p>
    <p>Lists. Use Word’s automatic bullet or number formats for lists.</p>
    <p>References: Use a 10 point Garamond font with a hanging indent of 0.25 inches.</p>
    <p>Other. Use other formats only when absolutely necessary.</p>
    <h2>Figures and Tables</h2>
    <p>A table is data presented in tabular format with rows and columns. A figure is any other pictorial representation
        of data such as graphs or drawings. Each figure or table must be numbered and have a brief caption that
        describes it. Every figure or table must be referenced in the body of the paper. Table 1 is an example of a
        table and Figure 1 is an example of a figure.</p>
    <p>Table 1. Example of a table</p>
    <p>Figure 1. Example of a figure</p>
    <p>The caption for tables is placed above the table; the caption for figures is placed below the figure.</p>
    <p>All accepted papers need to be reformatted before publication; therefore, it is important that all figures and
        tables can be easily resized and/or moved. Since tables and figures may be moved during the final formatting, do
        not use “above” or “following” when referring to them; just give the table or figure number. Also, do not use
        automatic numbering of tables and figures as these can become corrupted when figures or tables must be
        rearranged. Tables and figures may be inserted directly into the paper or placed on separate pages at the end of
        the paper.</p>
    <p>Insert figures formatted as an image that can be resized if needed. It is best if they are inserted directly into
        the paper with “in line” wrapping.</p>
    <p>Do not send figures formatted as separate text boxes or groups of images on the page.</p>
    <h2>Copyright and Creative Common License</h2>
    <p>We will publish your paper under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License and the
        author retains the copyright.</p>
    <p>By submitting the paper, as author you certify the following:</p>
    <p>You hold copyright for this submission, and</p>
    <p>You warrant that you have not infringed on any copyright and assume full liability in case of copyright dispute.
    </p>
    <h2>Copyright Issues for Figures</h2>
    <p>There are three common sources of figures.</p>
    <p>Figures you have copied from another source, including a web site. You must contact the holder of the copyright
        for the image and get permission to use it. Cite the source and add “used with permission.”</p>
    <p>Figures that you create based on another’s work. You do not need to get permission but include in the citation
        “adapted from” or “based on” and give the source.</p>
    <p>Figures that are your original work. Since you hold the copyright for these, there are no copyright issues.</p>
    <h2>Entering References and Citations</h2>
    <p>References are to follow the current American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines. We have placed a
        summary of these guidelines on the web at

        You can also find information at Click on Style and Grammar Guidelines and select In-text Citations or
        References.</p>
    <p>List the sources alphabetically at the end of the paper under the References heading. Place entries in
        alphabetical order according to the last name of the first author. Within the text of your paper, cite sources
        by placing the author’s last name and the date in parentheses.</p>
    <p>Reference list. In the reference list, when a work has up to (and including) 20 authors, list all authors (last
        name followed by initials). Place a comma after the last name of each author and after that author’s initial(s).
        Place an ampersand (&) before the last author. If there are more than 20 authors, provide last names and
        initials of first 19 authors, insert three ellipsis points, and add the last author’s name. Follow the authors
        by the date, the title, and the source.</p>
    <p>In-text citations. If a work has two authors, include both authors in each in-text citation (Boyd & Cohen, 2003).
        If the work has three or more authors, in all in-text citations place only the first author followed by et al.
        (Gill et al., 2019).</p>
    <p>DOIs and URLs in Reference list. When citing sources from the Web, include the year of publication or the most
        recent update. End the entry with a DOI if it has one. DOIs begin with https://doi.org/ followed by numbers and
        letters that identify the document, for example, https://doi.org/10.28945/2714 If it does not have a DOI, end
        the entry with the URL. Do not end the path statement or a DOI with a period. DOIs can be found by going to and
        entering the reference entries for which you want DOIs.</p>
    <h2>Author</h2>
    <p>(Leave this blank when submitting for review.)</p>
    <p>Include one or two short paragraphs about each author. Please include a head and shoulder photo of each author.
        You should include this photo and bio when you are asked to upload your final, formatted, camera ready copy.
        However, if you need to, you can send the photos by email to as separate attachments and we will insert them for
        you.</p>
